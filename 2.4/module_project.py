Sprint 2.4 - Binary Search & Recursion CodeSignal Assignment


* Task 1 (multiple choice):

Which logarithmic expression is identical to the following exponential expression?

    2^n = 64

* Answer:
    log_2(64) = n



* Task 2 (multiple choice):

When solving an algorithmic coding challenge, which keywords should you look out for that 
might alert you that logarithims are involved?

* Answer:
    - divide in half
    - binary search
    - double



* Task 3 (multiple choice):

What type of search algorithm is used in this representation?

    1. {9-7-6-4-3-2-1} --- {6}
            
    2. {9-7-6-4-3-2-1} --- {4 < 6}
              ^
    3. {9-7-6}-4-3-2-1 --- {7 > 6}
          ^
    4. 9-7-{6}-4-3-2-1 --- {6 == 6}
            ^

* Answer:
    - binary search
